# sweepy
This is a version of Minesweeper written for tvOS using Xamarin. It's a work in progress but demonstrates how you can use SpriteKit to handle the drawing/animation and how to use the gesture recognizers to handle the remote control. 

This is running on the simulator and on a Dev Kit device and is working well. You will need the preview build available at http://forums.xamarin.com/discussion/52477/xamarin-ios-9-3-preview-for-ios-9-1-tvos-9-0-and-watchos-2-0 to build and test. 

To play, use the tap/select to clear the space and the Play/Pause button to mark the space. The app only started a few days ago but will work on the logic/performance improvements over the next chunk of time. It will only run the current level. It is a work in progress, so feel free to offer suggestions but will be updated over the next week.
